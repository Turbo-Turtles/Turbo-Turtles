# LiDAR

## Overview

In this branch we are going to implement the functionalities of the LiDAR sensor.

It is disposable and since May 07 2023 **not supported anymore**, due to unresolvable problems with the lidar_func ros package. \
Development is now performed in the [24-lidar-navigation](https://github.com/Turbo-Turtles/Turbo-Turtles/tree/24-lidar-navigation) branch.

### Functionalities

- mapping
- SLAM
- navigation
