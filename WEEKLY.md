  - polish documention for exposé

## Week 3

- ### Goals

  - LiDAR node
  - camera nodes
  - familiarize with haar cascade method
  - motor driver node
  - custom interfaces

- ### Progress

  - familiarize with haar cascade method
  - motor driver node
  - custom interfaces

## Week 4

- ### Goals

  - LiDAR node
  - camera nodes
  - training haar cascade model
  - start implementing LiDAR SLAM and Navigation
  - start implementing lane detection/following
  - meeting to review progress

- ### Progress

  - ~~LiDAR node~~
  - ~~camera nodes~~ (both put on halt <- (currently) not worthwhile, so they where delayed indefinitely)
  - training haar cascade model
  - start implementing LiDAR SLAM and Navigation
  - meeting to review progress

  - start implementing lane detection/following **(missing)**

## Week 5

- ### Goals

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - lane following
    - sign detection
    - get through tunnel
    - get through construction site

- ### Progress

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - sign detection (only stop sign, not reliable)
    - get through tunnel

## Week 6

- ### Goals

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - lane following
    - sign detection (other signs, improve reliability)
    - get through construction site
  - polish mid term presentation
  - meeting to review progress

- ### Progress

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - lane following (detection working)
    - sign detection (very good reliability, 5/8 signs trained)
  - polish mid term presentation
  - meeting to review progress

## Week 7

- ### Goals

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - lane following (improve)
    - sign detection (train remaining signs)
    - get through construction site

- ### Progress

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - sign detection (all trained)

## Week 8

- ### Goals

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - lane following (improve)
    - sign detection (more reliability on certain signs)
    - get through construction site
  - start consolidation of concepts (=> intelligence node; start with lane following and and sign detection?)
  - meeting to review progress

- ### Progress

  - create local gazebo sim
  - implement concepts for missions:
    - lane following (curves(somewhat working), only one line visible)
    - sign detection
    - get through construction site
  - meeting to review progress

## Week 9

- ### Goals

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - lane following (improve)
    - level cross (barrier open/close)
    - get through construction site
    - intersection
