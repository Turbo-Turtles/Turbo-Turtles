    - sign detection
    - get through tunnel
    - get through construction site

- ### Progress

## Week 6

- ### Goals

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - lane following
    - sign detection (other signs, improve reliability)

  - polish mid term presentation
  - meeting to review progress

- ### Progress

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - lane following (detection working)
    - sign detection (very good reliability, 5/8 signs trained)
  - polish mid term presentation
  - meeting to review progress

## Week 7

- ### Goals

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - lane following (improve)

## Week 8

- ### Goals

  - implement concepts for missions:
    - lane following (improve)
    - sign detection (more reliability on certain signs)
    - get through construction site
  - start consolidation of concepts (=> intelligence node; start with lane following and and sign detection?)
  - meeting to review progress

- ### Progress
