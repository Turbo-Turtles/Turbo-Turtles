# Simulation

A Gazebo Simulation to test code faster. \
But it also does not resemble the real world very good for results may vary between them.

The biggest problem is how much extra information is beeing sent from Gazebo, one usually would not get in the real world. \
For example the size of the whole map, even before everything was scanned. And it is perfectly aligned, which is far from realistic.
